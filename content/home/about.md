# Biography

I am currently a PhD student at [IRIT] ([location]) (Institut de Recherche en Informatique
de Toulouse, France) in the [LILaC] and [ADRIA] team.
[<img src="img/irit.png" style="max-width:30%;min-width:50px;float:right;margin:20px">][IRIT]
I am under the supervision of Olivier Gasquet (IRIT), Dominique Longin (CNRS),
Frédéric Maris (IRIT) and Andreas Herzig (CNRS).

Some extra information on me is available on the lab's [profile].

My PhD thesis consists in developing a tool and language, [TouIST]
\(pronounced _twist_, standing for _Toulouse Integrated Satisfiability
Tool_\), that will allow us to express and solve real-world problems
through the use of multiple logic theories: SAT, SMT and QBF for now.

[^touist-meaning]: _**Tou**louse **i**ntegrated **s**atisfiability **t**ool_.
                   it is prononced _twist_. we were looking for a memorable and
                   pronounceable name that had no homonym on google. and it
                   had to sound like fun, too!
