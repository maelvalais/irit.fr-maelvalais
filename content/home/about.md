# Biography

> **Note:** if you want the most up-to-date information about me, I
> recommend taking a look at my [LinkedIn][linkedin] page.

I am currently employed by [SQUAD] and am currently contracted to La Banque
Postale (Toulouse, France). I work on tools for network administrators,
including a web front-end to Ansible Tower APIs.

Before that, I was contracted to Orange, where I worked on tools for
developers, examples and documentation in order to improve the developer
experience when it comes to using the Orange IT's private cloud. I also try
to promote and find new ways to guide people into sharing their own code as
well getting the most out of Orange's internal GitLab.

On April, 10th 2019, I defended my PhD thesis at [IRIT] \(Institut de
Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse, France – [location]) in the [LILaC]
and [ADRIA] team. My PhD work was supervised by Olivier Gasquet (IRIT),
Dominique Longin (CNRS), Frédéric Maris (IRIT) and Andreas Herzig (CNRS).
My goal was to develop a tool and a language, [TouIST] \(pronounced
_twist_, standing for _Toulouse Integrated Satisfiability Tool_\), that
will allow us to express and solve real-world problems through the use of
multiple logic theories: SAT, SMT and QBF for now.

[^touist-meaning]:

  _**Tou**louse **i**ntegrated **s**atisfiability **t**ool_.
  it is prononced _twist_. we were looking for a memorable and
  pronounceable name that had no homonym on google. and it
  had to sound like fun, too!
