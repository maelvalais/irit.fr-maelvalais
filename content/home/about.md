# Biography

I am currently employed as a contractor at Orange, Toulouse (France). I
work on tools for developers, examples and documentation in order to improve
the developer experience when it comes to using the Orange IT's private
cloud. I also try to promote and find new ways to guide people into sharing
their own code as well getting the most out of Orange's internal GitLab.

<!-- In Oct. 2018, I chose to stop my PhD and move on towards engineering stuff.
The main reason is that I was bored as hell doing theoretic stuff all day. What
I loved most during the two years of my unfinished PhD was the development
part. So I gathered everything I loved about programming and found a job that
matched. -->

Since Oct. 2016, I am also a PhD student at [IRIT] \(Institut de Recherche en
Informatique de Toulouse, France – [location]) in the [LILaC] and [ADRIA] team.
The manuscript is ready and I will be defending in early 2019.

My PhD work is supervised by Olivier Gasquet (IRIT), Dominique Longin (CNRS),
Frédéric Maris (IRIT) and Andreas Herzig (CNRS). My goal is to develop a tool
and a language, [TouIST] \(pronounced _twist_, standing for _Toulouse Integrated
Satisfiability Tool_\), that will allow us to express and solve real-world
problems through the use of multiple logic theories: SAT, SMT and QBF for now.

[^touist-meaning]:

  _**Tou**louse **i**ntegrated **s**atisfiability **t**ool_.
  it is prononced _twist_. we were looking for a memorable and
  pronounceable name that had no homonym on google. and it
  had to sound like fun, too!
